All great stories look as simple as the ugly real world when they happen. It's only when I open my eyes, I realise how beautiful it was. Like a dream. Not just because it was beautiful, but also for the fact that I can't go back there. I may realise how desperate I am to go back there when I see it fading away. But it became vintage in no time and left me wondering about watching myself like a history. Like a story.
